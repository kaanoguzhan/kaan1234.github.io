description: 
    Explainable AI techniques usually provide explanations to humans about how a machine learning model works. <br> 
    Some recent research has tried to do the opposite, humans giving explanations to machines. <br>
    This exchange of information in a loop style results in increased accuracy and predictions more coherent with human intuition.
